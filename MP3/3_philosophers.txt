NOTE:::: 
	I put first Tanenbaum solution(solution 1) with starvation-free in 3_philosophers.py, 
	and second Tanenbaum solution(solution 2) with starvation-free in 3_Tanenbaum_solution_2.py


with starvation, result are this:

	Num of philosophers: 20 
	NUm of meal per philosophers: 100

	1. Footman solution---Time: 23.900s
	2. left_hand solution ---Time: 21.323s
	3. Tanenbaum solution ---Time: 15.342s


After solving starvation of Tanenbaum solution:

	Num of philosophers: 5 
	Num of meal per philosophers: 100

	1. Footman solution---Time: 17.786s
	2. left_hand solution ---Time: 16.718s
	3. Tanenbaum solution(solution 1) ---Time: 15.510s
	4. Tanenbaum solution(solution 2)  ---Time: 16.060s


Summary:

According to my result, 
Tanenbaum method are best. For Footman and left_hand methods, there has two situation that 
block philosophers, one is that its left/right philosophers is eating, current philosopher cannot get forks, 
the other is that its right philosophers is waiting for its right of its right philosopher, same to left philosopher.
For Tanenbaum method, only one situation exists, the situation is its left/right philosophers is eating. 

left_hand method is better than Footman method. I have tested almost 20 groups data(combination of num of philosopher(max = 20)
 and different num of meal per philosopher(max = 1000)). I found that left_hand speed is always quicker. 
I don't understand fully why this happends. As far as I understand, let's assume Num of philosophers is 5,  
both methods allow two philosophers eat at the same time, but footman only allows 4 philosophers to have chance to get forks, 
left_hand allows 5 to get forks. Maybe this situation exists: for footman, there have two philosophers are eating, if one philosopher finished eating, 
another philosopher could come in, but this coming guy also needs forks from the other philosopher who is eating, 
so only one philosopher could eat in this time. When other philosophers who could eat come, time(waiting for this guy who is allowed come by footman)
has wasted.
