# Operating system practice

* Introduce new accounting mechanism to compute burst time and change the scheduling algorithm to SRTF.
* Creating new API to support kernel level threading.
* Improving the UFS system to hold more blocks of data per file.
* Solving concurrency and synchronization applications/problems using python semaphore library.
